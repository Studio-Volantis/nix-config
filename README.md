### Alacritty
[GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia)-accelerated terminal (why?). Speeds up `cmatrix` by a whopping 5 frames, enough frames to get that Hackerman™ feel. Still, it has weird `cava` glitches up the [wazoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahoo). I don't care since I use `cool-retro-term` anyway.

### Bspwm
[Binary Space Partitioning Window Manager](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm). Better than `i3`. Makes you do [binary tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/) calculations before you can resize your windows and organize your workspace.

### Cava
Who said equalizers are a thing of the past? Just because you want *simplicity* doesn't mean you have to throw away the good ol' visualizer! Slap this *not-that-much-modified-from-the-default* config file to `~/.config/cava` and give your terminal some [musical bling bling](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4237/bloatware).

### Ckb-next
[Corsair iCUE](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4237/bloatware) for GNU/Linux. I use it because I'm a [GAMER™](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/basement-dweller) and I game on **MICROSOFT WINDOWS 10**. I use this to manage the lighting on my [wonderful, premium, *aesthetic* gaming peripherals](https://ludwig.guru/s/overpriced+hardware). But hey, at least it's FOSS and not iCUE!

### Cool Retro Term
The best [POS terminal](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26649/point-of-sale-terminal-pos-terminal) emulator for Linux. Period. Hands down. Easily. [Much wow.](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dead%20meme)

### Devilspie
The pie of the [devil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)). Used this quite a bit when I was using KDE (the K Desktop Environment) but since then I've made the switch to `bspwm` and I've been living a much simpler life away from the [devil's pie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism).

### Dunst
Windows 10 Action Center > dunst, unfortunately.

### GRUB
Config for the thing that makes my computer turn on. My [`rEFInd`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/rEFInd) installation died for this because I moved to a LUKS setup. Rest in peace my beautiful, sleek, boot menu.

### i3
[I don't care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdZya6yATn0). Moved to `bspwm` anyway.

### Mkinitcpio/Mkinitpcio
`mkinitcpio` or `mkinitpcio`? Idk, I always get those two mixed up and only one of them is correct. Lucky for you, the answer is the *latter*. Or is it? Idk tbh.

### MPD
The [magnetoplasmadynamic thruster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoplasmadynamic_thruster). [Doesn't want to work anyway](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trash). Config files to be stored as a "just in case."

### Nginx
The [Engine X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_engine) [7-stage "reverse proxy"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/good-luck-im-behind-7-proxies). An integral part of my [LEMP Stack](https://lemp.io/) installation. [Harder, better, faster, stronger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harder,_Better,_Faster,_Stronger) than your typical [LAMP Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampshade) and consumes less RAM.

### Polybar
`polybar` + [tiling WM](https://meteatamel.wordpress.com/2014/12/25/unnecessary-complexity-why-does-it-happen/) + `cava`/[some other terminal plaything](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4237/bloatware) = at least **100** upvotes on [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/).

### Rofi
Ditch Microsoft Cortuna and Apple's iSeeri in favor of a manually-controlled program to help run commands, open applications, and [paste emojis](https://github.com/Mange/rofi-emoji). This thing does it all and is a pillar of a good `bpswm` setup.

### Sxhkd
Sx... hotkey [daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon)? I dunno, too lazy to look it up. Custom keybindings for use with the magical `bspwm` **tiling** window manager.

### Tmux
Tmux is a, erm, [terminal multiplexor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing) thing. It [plexes your terminal emulator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plex_(software)) multiple times? I don't know. Point is: it's **AWESOME** and I feel bad if I were to use a terminal without it.

### Oh My Zsh

### Zsh
[Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) is best shell. And the config file makes it even better. So it's like best shell<sup>2</sup>. I reckon that if I add another config here, my Zsh terminal will be the (best shell<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>
